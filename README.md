#### Enter the dungeon
This is the realization of a project done for the Computer Graphics course at Politecnico di Milano. 
It is the representation of a dungeon, done in WebGL2. Note that a local server is needed in order to load the shaders
and the models. Having developed for Google Chrome, we used Web Server for Chrome (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog).
In order to correctly load the assets, you have to choose the main directory in which you clone the project as source.
Have fun!
